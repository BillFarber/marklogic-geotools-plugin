# MarkLogic Geotools Plugin
The MarkLogic Geotools plugin allows you to configure a GeoServer instance (http://geoserver.org) to
use MarkLogic as a data store.

Installation instructions can be found in INSTALL.md.

Note: This project currently relies upon code that is in progress to be merged into the MarkLogic Geo Data Services project.
